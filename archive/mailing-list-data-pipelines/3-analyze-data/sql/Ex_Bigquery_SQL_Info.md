## project-OCEAN SQL Information for Data Analysis 

Example SQL to explore metadata for existing BigQuery repos using Libraries.io dataset.

Also checkout this [post](https://medium.com/google-cloud/bigquery-dataset-metadata-queries-8866fa947378) that walks through these BigQuery queries.

### Naming Best Practices

When saving sql queries, views, datasets or tables use the following naming convention:
*nameoffile-4digyear-month-day-initials*

* Use a descriptive name to make it clear what you are saving
* Put the date in order of year-month-date
* Include your initials and add middle initial if you have it
* Use - where you can and _ if you canâ€™t


### Exampl Metadata Queries

Query to get table schema.

    SELECT * FROM bigquery-public-data.libraries_io.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES


Query for more detailed table schema info including lastest update date, number of rows and size.

    SELECT s.table_catalog, s.table_schema, s.table_name, s.table_type, s.is_insertable_into, s.is_typed, CAST(TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(s.creation_time) AS DATETIME) as creation_time, CAST(TIMESTAMP_MILLIS(t.last_modified_time) AS DATETIME) as last_modified_time, t.row_count, t.size_bytes / POW(10,9) as GB, t.type FROM bigquery-public-data.libraries_io.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES s 
    JOIN bigquery-public-data.libraries_io.__TABLES__ t 
    ON s.table_name = t.table_id


Query to get column information for a table.

    SELECT * 
    FROM bigquery-public-data.libraries_io.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
    WHERE TABLE_NAME = "repositories"
